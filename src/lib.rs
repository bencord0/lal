#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! This is the rust doc for the `lal` *library* - what the `lal` *binary*
//! depends on to do all the work. This documentation is likely only of use to you
//! if you need to know the internals of `lal` for figuring out how to modify it.
//!
//! ## Testing
//! The library contains all the logic because the binary is only an argument parser,
//! and elaborate decision making engine to log, call one of the libraries functions,
//! then simply `process::exit`.
//! Tests do not cover the binary part, because these failures would be trivially
//! detectable, and also require a subprocess type of testing. Tests instead
//! cover a couple of common use flows through the library.
//!
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//! This tool depends on the rust ecosystem and their crates. Dependencies referenced
//! explicitly or implicitly is listed on the left of this page.
